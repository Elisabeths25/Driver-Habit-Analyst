# Driver-Habit-Analyst
Some people have a habit of driving a car. Some people were focused on driving and some weren't, like using a cell phone while driving. Using Machine Learning, especially the Convolution Neuron Network, this project will divide driving habits into 2, namely 0 = unfocused driver, and 1 = focused driver.
